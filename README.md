# Animated Website

## Introduction

The Animated Website project is a modern, interactive front‑end website that leverages smooth animations and dynamic visual effects. The project uses HTML and CSS for its structure and styling, while JavaScript powers the interactive elements. Animation libraries such as GSAP and Sheryjs are integrated to create seamless transitions, animated text blocks, and dynamic background effects. For instance, the background images are animated using Sheryjs and custom configurations that manipulate various effect parameters, while text elements shift dynamically on user interactions using GSAP (fileciteturn0file2 and fileciteturn0file3).

This repository is designed as a frontend demonstration project which can be used as inspiration or as a starting point for more comprehensive interactive websites. All animations are coded directly, making it easy for developers to learn how to integrate animation libraries such as GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and Sheryjs into their projects.

## Usage

To set up and use this project, follow these steps:

**Installation Steps:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   Use Git to clone the repository locally.
   Code example:
   <pre>
   git clone https://github.com/Rituraj27/Animated-Website.git
   </pre>
2. **Open the Project Folder:**  
   Navigate to the cloned repository.
3. **Check the File Structure:**  
   The main files include:
   - **index.html:** Contains the main HTML structure along with external script and style references (fileciteturn0file3).
   - **style.css:** Manages the styling and layout of the website.
   - **script.js:** Contains the JavaScript code, configuring both GSAP animations and Sheryjs image effects (fileciteturn0file2).
   - **assets/images:** Folder with example images used by the project.
4. **Run the Project:**  
   Simply open the "index.html" file in your preferred browser. Ensure you have an active internet connection in order to load library dependencies from CDNs (such as GSAP, Sheryjs, and others referenced in the HTML file).

**Customizing Animations:**

- **GSAP Animations:**  
  The script uses GSAP for controlling timed animations. You can modify the animation duration, easing, or trigger parameters by updating the related code sections in script.js.
- **Sheryjs Effects:**  
  The parameters for image effects (like style, noise values, and displace amounts) can be adjusted within the Shery.imageEffect method in script.js to tailor the visual effects to your preferences.
